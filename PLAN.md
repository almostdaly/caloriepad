# CaloriePad - Food Intake Tracking App Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

A minimalistic food intake tracking app that integrates with Apple Health data to provide a running total of calories consumed vs calories burned. The app focuses on simplicity and native iOS experience rather than precise calorie counting.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### Component Architecture Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

**🚨 RECURRING ISSUE**: Components grow too large and violate single responsibility principle.

**MANDATORY COMPONENT PATTERNS:**

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Single responsibility, prop-driven components
interface SearchInputProps {
  value: string;
  onChangeText: (text: string) => void;
  onClear: () => void;
}

export function SearchInput({
  value,
  onChangeText,
  onClear,
}: SearchInputProps) {
  // Does ONE thing: handles search input with clear functionality
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Compose complex functionality
function QuickAddFood() {
  return (
    <View>
      <SearchInput />
      <SuggestionsList />
      <CalorieControls />
      <TotalDisplay />
    </View>
  );
}

// ❌ WRONG: Monolithic component doing everything
function QuickAddFood() {
  // 500+ lines handling search, suggestions, controls, animation, etc.
}
```

**REQUIRED COMPONENT BREAKDOWN RULES:**

1. ✅ Component > 150 lines = immediate refactor required
2. ✅ One component = one responsibility (search, display, control, etc.)
3. ✅ Props-driven, no internal state when possible
4. ✅ Create component folders with index.ts exports
5. ✅ Use composition pattern for complex UIs
6. ✅ Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

### CODE ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS (NEW - MANDATORY)

**🚨 ENFORCED**: Single component per file, maximum 150 lines per component

**COMPONENT ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE:**

```
components/
├── common/              # Shared components (Button, Input, etc.)
├── food/               # Food feature components
├── today/              # Today screen components
├── settings/           # Settings screen components
└── [screen]/           # Other screen-specific components
```

**FILE NAMING STANDARDS:**

- One component per file, named exactly as the component
- Folder structure: `ComponentName/index.ts` + `ComponentName.tsx`
- Services split by domain: `foodService.ts`, `healthService.ts`, etc.
- Utilities extracted to: `utils/formatters.ts`, `utils/validators.ts`

**SIZE LIMITS (ENFORCED):**

- Components: 150 lines maximum
- Services: 200 lines maximum
- Props: 5 maximum (use config objects beyond this)
- useState hooks: 3 maximum per component

### Dark Mode Styling Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

**🚨 RECURRING ISSUE**: Components keep having dark mode styling problems.

**MANDATORY PATTERN FOR ALL COMPONENTS:**

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Always do this pattern
const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
const colors = Colors[colorScheme ?? 'light'];

// ✅ CORRECT: Use colors object throughout component
<ThemedView style={[styles.container, {
  backgroundColor: colors.cardBackground,
  borderColor: colors.cardBorder
}]}>
  <ThemedText style={{ color: colors.text }}>Content</ThemedText>
</ThemedView>

// ❌ WRONG: Never hardcode opacity or use inline Colors[colorScheme]
<ThemedText style={{ opacity: 0.7 }}>Text</ThemedText> // Use colors.textSecondary instead
<View style={{ backgroundColor: Colors[colorScheme ?? 'light'].cardBackground }} /> // Use colors variable
```

**REQUIRED CHECKS BEFORE ANY COMPONENT IS COMPLETE:**

1. ✅ Extract `colors` variable at component start
2. ✅ All nested ThemedViews use `backgroundColor: 'transparent'`
3. ✅ All text colors explicitly set with `color: colors.text/textSecondary`
4. ✅ No hardcoded `opacity` values - use semantic color names
5. ✅ All cards have `borderColor: colors.cardBorder`
6. ✅ Test in BOTH light and dark modes before marking complete

**This pattern MUST be followed religiously to prevent dark mode issues from recurring.**

```

### Data Models

```typescript
interface FoodItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  caloriesPerServing: number;
  servingSize: string;
  category: "food" | "drink" | "snack";
  isFavorite: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface FoodEntry {
  id: string;
  foodItem: FoodItem;
  quantity: number;
  totalCalories: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  notes?: string;
}

interface DayData {
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD
  entries: FoodEntry[];
  totalCaloriesConsumed: number;
  totalCaloriesBurned: number; // from Apple Health
  netCalories: number;
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles

### Design Language

- **Minimalistic**: Clean, uncluttered interface
- **Native iOS**: Use iOS design patterns and SF Symbols
- **One-handed use**: Primary actions easily accessible
- **Quick entry**: Minimize taps to add items

### Color Scheme

- **Light Mode**: iOS system colors with custom accent
- **Dark Mode**: True black backgrounds with subtle grays
- **Accent Color**: Health green (#30D158) for positive actions

### Key Screens Layout

1. **Today Screen**: Running total, recent entries, quick-add favoritesm stats oriented, numeric and cool visualizations
2. **Add Food Screen**: Search/browse with calorie estimates, simple & minimalistic
3. **Favorites Screen**: One-tap add for common items
4. **History Screen**: Past days with trends

## 📊 Current Progress Status

**Overall Progress: ~70% Complete**

✅ **COMPLETED**: Phase 1 (Core Foundation) + Phase 2 (Food Database & Entry) + Phase 3 (Today Screen)  
⏳ **PENDING**: Phase 4 (Developer Tools) + Phase 5 (User Onboarding) + Phase 6 (Apple Health) + Phase 7 (History & Polish)

## 🍎 Apple Health Integration Strategy

### Required Permissions

**Energy & Activity Data:**

- `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierActiveEnergyBurned`
- `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBasalEnergyBurned`

**Physical Characteristics:**

- `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeight`
- `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBodyMass`
- `HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierBiologicalSex`
- `HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierDateOfBirth`

### Data Synchronization

- Fetch daily active energy on app launch
- Update every hour when app is active
- Cache health data locally to reduce API calls
- Graceful fallback when health data unavailable

### Privacy Considerations

- Clear permission requests with explanations
- Local data storage only
- Option to use app without health integration

## 💾 Local Storage Strategy

### AsyncStorage Keys

```typescript
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  FOOD_DATABASE: "@caloriepad/food_database",
  DAILY_ENTRIES: "@caloriepad/entries_", // + date
  FAVORITES: "@caloriepad/favorites",
  USER_SETTINGS: "@caloriepad/settings",
  HEALTH_CACHE: "@caloriepad/health_cache",
  ONBOARDING_STATUS: "@caloriepad/onboarding_status",
};
```

### Data Persistence

- Daily entries stored separately by date
- Favorites list updated immediately
- Health data cached with timestamps
- Settings persisted on change

## 📱 Key Features Breakdown

### Quick Add System

- Floating action button on main screen
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Voice search integration (future)
- Barcode scanning (future enhancement)

### Calorie Reference Database

- ~200 common foods with estimates
- Categories: meals, snacks, drinks
- Serving size variations
- User can add custom items
- Is there an open source/public API we can use for this data?

### Smart Suggestions

- Learn from user patterns
- Suggest foods based on time of day
- Promote healthy choices subtly

## 🔧 Development Considerations

### Performance

- Lazy load food database
- Optimize list rendering with VirtualizedList
- Minimize health data API calls
- Efficient AsyncStorage operations

### Error Handling

- Graceful health permission failures
- Offline functionality
- Data corruption recovery
- User-friendly error messages

## 📋 Success Metrics

- < 3 taps to add a food item
- < 2 seconds app launch time
- 95% uptime for health data sync
- Intuitive first-use experience

## 🚧 Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Apple Watch companion app
- Meal planning suggestions
- Photo food logging
- Integration with other health apps
- Export to Apple Health (nutrition data)
